This project contains the JNI to our C Core. The project is not meant to be built independently but 
included as a submodule to Android/OEM SDK-s. The SDK-s will include the files from here and use their
own build systems to create a binary.

Prebuiltlibs contains OpenSSL binaries. Linux ones are 1.1.0i, others 1.0.2.m.
